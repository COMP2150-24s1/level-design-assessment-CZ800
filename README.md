## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)


### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

As the player makes progress throughout my game, the player learns to use the weapons and tools in their arsenal as well as their wits to overcome the many challenges that stand in their way. Throughout their journey, the player learns to utilise their skills in platforming to jump over spikes, acid lakes and enemies while utilising their weapons to dispatch enemies. Through the encouraging of the player's curiosity, they learn to explore in areas that deviate from the main path to find secrets and extra supplies that may help them on their journey. All of these factors are imperative to the concept of good design practice as they help encourage a player's natural instincts whilst simultaneously keeping the experience fun and entertaining.

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

My design facilitates the intensity of the level steadily throughout the game's 3 sections. During the first sections, the game starts off at a low intensity, limiting the player to a simple platforming test, jumping around spikes and moving platforms while following a linear path of progression. Coupled with this linearity, the player is also deprived of their weapons and enemies to fight, allowing them the chance to acclimate to the game's base mechanics before introducing harder factors. At the end of the first section, a brief moment of relief is provided as the player hits a checkpoint and is introduced to the first weapon mechanic in the game and a stationary enemy to test it on. Section 2 ramps up the intensity by introducing the primary enemies of the game as well as the option for the player to explore their surroundings. With the addition of several 'alternate' paths that lead to 'high risk/high reward' sections of the map, the player is rewarded for their curiosity and further encouraged to explore their surroundings for a better chance at survival. The final and third section peaks the intensity curve by presenting the player with the most challenging obstacles yet. With the addition of several more enemies, harder obstacles and the addition of multiple threats in conjunction with one another, the player is faced with a high difficulty 'final level' that relentlessly challenges their skill level through an intense but fair gauntlet of traps and dangers that provide both tension in the moment and relief once it is overcome.

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

The main challenges of the level come from both the environment and the enemies that the player faces on their journey. Throughout the first section, I designed the challenges to be simple tests of the player's skill in platforming, limiting the only dangers to simple spikes and acid lakes. While it is still very much possible to fail here early on, the beginning section is by no means difficult and players with sufficient skill in platforming should experience no trouble reaching the first checkpoint. The second section of the level introduces the weapons and the enemies. Here the challenge and difficulty increases dramatically as here, the player's cunning and decision making skills will also be tested. At the beginning of section 2, I designed the level so that the player would immediately see the gun pickup on the right side of the screen and walk over to pick it up. As they do so, the camera pans over to a spitter enemy, a stationary target that is conveniently placed just far enough away that it doesn't notice the player. This provides players the chance to test out their new toy and gain a grip on one of the game's key mechanics. 

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

The design of my game facilitates autonomy and encourages exploration through the inclusion of choice for the player. In many areas in sections 2 and 3 of the level, players are offered the choice to travel to a section of the map that is off the main path or otherwise locked behind a destructible wall that players can double back to once they've found the appropriate equipment. These sections of the game offer the player a choice of high risk/high reward payoffs where the player can choose to test their skills for additional loot. If the player is unsuccessful, the highly difficult areas will likely kill them and lose them the game. However, if the player is skilled enough to overcome these optional challenges, they are rewarded with high amounts of loot(usually health) that makes their sacrifice worth it.

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)

### 2.1. Passthrough Platforms
The passthrough platform is the first 'obstacle' the player faces when they start the game. In the level, the platform serves as more of a 'stepping-stone' that an obstacle, letting the player jump up and begin the first section properly. The passthrough platform was included to introduce players to the mechanic of jumping through platforms to land on them and gain height.

### 2.2. Moving Platforms
The moving platform was introduced in conjunction with the next obstacle to provide the first challenge the player faced. The unstationary nature of the obstacle provided an added layer of difficulty for the players with minor punishments if they failed to land onto the platform.
![Moving Platforms](DocImages/Moving%20platform.png)

### 2.3. Spikes
Spikes were introduced in conjuntion with moving platforms to create a pit that players could fall into. If players were unable to successfully jump from one platform to another, they would plummet into the spikes and lose 1 hp.
![Spikes](DocImages/Spikes.png)

### 2.4. Acid
Acid was introduced as the first major threat to the player. With its ability to instantly send the player back to the previous checkpoint, acid posed a much higher threat than spikes and provided much higher incentive to not fail.

### 2.5. Keys
The first key is a crucial part of the level's design, without it the player would likely be lost and unable to complete the game. In the first section, the key is placed directly in the path of the player, allowing them to gain a clear visual of what their goal looked like so they knew what they were looking for.
![Keys](DocImages/Key.png)

### 2.6. Health Pickups
Health pickups are scattered all around the map, often in areas away from the main linear gameplay or in places heavily guarded by enemies. This was done to provide players with a risk/reward dilemma: continue the game with your current health level or risk it all for a high chance of survival.
![Health Pickups](DocImages/Health%20pickup.png)

### 2.7. Checkpoints
Checkpoints in the game signified 'safe-spaces' and spots where tension is relieved, signalling the end of the previous section and the beginning of a new one.
![Checkpoints](DocImages/Checkpoint.png)

### 2.8. Spitters
Spitters are the first enemy introduced in the game. They are stationary foes that are placed perched on high platforms to give them a vantage point where they can attack the player in a position that would be hard to eliminate them from.
![Spitters](DocImages/Spitter.png)

### 2.9. Weapon Pickup (Gun)
The gun is the first and primary weapon of the level. It is a ranged weapon that can easily dispatch any enemy in a single hit. The positioning of the weapon pickup was purposefully done to teach players the basic mechanics of how to fire and use the weapon against an enemy. By placing the weapon next to a spitter, players are easily clued in as to what they're supposed to do next.

### 2.10. Chompers
The chomper was introduced as the second enemy that menaced the player through the level. Unlike its spitting counterpart, the chomper is mobile and attacks using a close range bite. As the chomper is far more dangerous in close range, they were often positioned in close-quarters areas where the player had little room to manuever, providing high amounts of tension and difficulty.

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)
The staff was the second weapon introduced to the level and is a melee weapon capable to breaking down destructible walls. The staff was positioned so that the player would encounter it after they had already seen various destructible walls, allowing them to use the staff to access previously blocked areas.

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)

The usage of an iterative design process has tremendously helped me in designing and improving my level. This design process allowed me to design each section of my level separately, granting me the opportunity to give equal amounts of undivided attention to craft each section meticulously. Through the usage of storyboarding and physical prototyping, I utilised early sketches on paper to roughly shape my desired outcomes before I replicated them in unity. By using this method of sketching the level beforehand, it allowed me to quickly brainstorm ideas for environmental hazards, traps and enemy placement as well as being able to effectively pinpoint the areas where I felt the design was inconvenient or erroneous. For example, during Section 1, the portion of the map right after the first spike trap received the first major changes in the final design.![Annotated Section 1](DocImages/Annotated%20section%201.png) During playtesting, I realised that the first key was often too easy to miss which would have made the entire rest of the game virtually unbeatable. To combat this design flaw, a direct linear path to the key was implemented so that players would not be able to miss the key and therefore wouldn't break the game entirely from the very beginning. The second major change to the game occured during the second section with the addition of an entirely new secret room just beneath the second checkpoint. ![Annotated Section 2](DocImages/Annotated%20section%202.png) This room was added after the prototypes were developed to provide players with the chance to explore their surroundings. Should players choose to travel off the beaten path, they would be rewarded with a room full of loot as well as enemies that would provide them a challenge. Ultimately, this room was implemented to give players a high risk/high reward opportunity to gain extra health and loot. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of my level design that could have used more iterative designing occurs during section 3 within the pathway that leads to the third key. ![Annotated Section 3](DocImages/Annotated%20section%203.png) While the correct path is not exactly hidden, it can be easily missed however and it is usually extremely hard or impossible to collect the third key if the player makes a wrong turn too late. Therefore, this aspect of the level design could have been improved through further iterative development.
